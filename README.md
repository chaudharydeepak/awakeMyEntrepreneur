Application to fire-up your tech instinct and more.

#### Motivation [<i>or frustration</i>]

* I am big fan of websites/apps such as LinkedIn / Udemy / builtIns etc. Primarily I visit these sites to learn new tools / technologies and watchout for upcoming tech trends.
* However at times, these websites gets polluted by ads / and social posts etc. Hence frustration, to search for a single platform that provides high-quality tech content and trends / at the same time allow to build entrepreneurial spirit collaborating with other startup(s).

* Build a single platform capable of following-
```
1. High quality content from internet per user(s) interest. This will be achived via high-performing web crawlers.
2. Allow startup inspirations - just not the shiny highs, but daily grinds/ and the following rises.
3. Additionalyy, possibly allow startups to colloborate[ needs ].
4. Allow user to create their own content and share.
```
This is work in progres and idea will shape over time.
